                                    <p>Playing content that is protected by copyright (DMCA) is strictly prohibited. This includes copyrighted movies, music, and other protected materials.

                                    <p>You must have a working, clear microphone.</p>
                                    <p>Engaging in Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is strictly prohibited within our community. This encompasses any form of explicit or sexually suggestive content, including the posting of nudity or lewd materials.</p>
                                    <p>It is important to refrain from influencing or encouraging others to break the rules. Such behavior can have consequences, and you may receive a similar punishment for your actions.</p>
                                    <p>Real-life events, including suicide roleplay, terrorism threats, pandemics, and mental illnesses, are strictly prohibited within the city. We prioritize the well-being and safety of our community members and strive to provide an enjoyable and inclusive environment. We kindly request that you refrain from incorporating or depicting such sensitive topics in your roleplay.</p>
                                    <p>Roleplay should continue unless all parties involved in the scene or situation agree to pause or stop it. It is important to respect the consent and comfort of all participants. If there is a disagreement or discomfort during roleplay, it is essential to communicate openly and reach a consensus among all involved parties.</p>
                                    <p>It is strictly prohibited to use explicit or offensive names on any SinCity Roleplay platforms.</p>

                                    <div class="date">Last Updated: April 14, 2025</div>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Account</strong></p>
                                    <p>You are solely responsible for all activities and actions that take place on your account. It is important to maintain the security of your account and ensure that you use it in accordance with the community guidelines and applicable rules. Any unauthorized use or misuse of your account may have consequences.</p>  
                                    <p>The buying or selling of accounts and/or valuables from other users, except through official channels facilitated by the server owner, is strictly prohibited. Engaging in such transactions can lead to various risks, including scams, permanent character death, or bans. It is important to note that the community cannot be held accountable for any negative outcomes resulting from such unauthorized transactions. We strongly advise against engaging in these activities and encourage users to follow the official guidelines provided by the server owner for account-related transactions.</p>  
                                    <p>If you lose access to your Discord account, please note that we are unable to transfer the Allowlist status to another Discord account. It is crucial to ensure the security and retention of your own Discord account to maintain your Allowlist status. We recommend taking necessary precautions to protect your account, such as enabling two-factor authentication and keeping your login credentials secure. In the event of an account loss, it will be necessary to reapply for Allowlist status with your new Discord account.</p>  
                                
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Donations</strong></p>                                     
                                    <p>We understand that mistakes or unforeseen circumstances can occur, and we strive to accommodate our community members. Therefore, we offer a 24-hour window for refund requests on donations and purchases. If you believe there has been an error or if you find yourself in a unique situation, please reach out to <a href="https://discord.com/users/706088893044359168">Krish Uprety </a>, the owner, or open Ticket in Discord Server within 24 hours of the transaction. They will carefully consider your request and provide assistance accordingly. Your satisfaction and overall experience within our community are important to us.</p>
                                    <p>When making purchases or donations, the perks and benefits associated with them are tied to your specific account. During the process, you will be asked to specify the character to which the donation perks should be allocated. It is important to note that once the perks are granted to a character, you cannot change your selection in the future or transfer them to another character or account. Please make sure to carefully consider your choice before finalizing the allocation.</p>
                                    <p>In the event that a buyer is banned for violating the server rules, it is important to note that any purchases made by the buyer will not be refunded.</p>
                                    <p>In the case of a chargeback, it is important to note that any associated bans resulting from violating server rules cannot be appealed. Chargebacks refer to the reversal of a payment, and engaging in such actions can have serious consequences, including the forfeiture of the ability to appeal bans. We strongly advise against initiating chargebacks and encourage all community members to resolve any concerns or issues through proper channels, such as contacting server administrators or support. It is crucial to maintain open communication and address any concerns in a responsible and respectful manner.</p>
                                    <p>The selling of any items obtained through purchases is strictly prohibited within our community. We emphasize that purchased items are intended for personal use and enjoyment, and their sale to other members or third parties is not permitted.</p>                                
                                    
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Character</strong></p>

                                    <p>Members serving as Police, Department of Corrections (DOC), Department of Justice (DOJ) and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are strictly prohibited from engaging in any form of moderate or serious corruption. This includes actions such as giving away or selling equipment for personal gain. These roles are expected to uphold the highest standards of integrity, professionalism, and ethical conduct.</p>
                                    <p>It is essential to maintain a clear separation between your characters. Each character should exist independently, without any knowledge of the others' personal information, such as their weed location, relationships with friends or enemies, or any other details. It is crucial to avoid creating connections or relationships between characters that extend beyond the established roleplay context. By respecting this separation, you contribute to a more immersive and authentic roleplaying experience for all community members.</p>
                                    <p>Character names must adhere to a serious and appropriate tone. The use of meme names is not allowed and may result in disciplinary action or a name change without prior notice.</p>
                                    <p>Having multiple characters affiliated with the same circle or gang is not permitted within our community. It is important to maintain a clear separation between your characters' affiliations and roleplay experiences. Each character should have their own unique identity, connections, and associations. This rule ensures a more diverse and authentic roleplaying environment where interactions and conflicts remain distinct and separate.</p>
                                    <p>If a player has a camera on their character, they can use recordings as legal evidence, otherwise, they cannot.</p>
                                    <p>The inclusion of characters such as Serial Killers, Robots, Paranormal Characters, and other unique concepts requires prior approval from the staff team.</p>
                                    <p>To ensure an active and dynamic environment, we reserve the right to remove properties, including vehicles and houses, if a player has been inactive on the server for approximately 90 days. The purpose of this policy is to prevent properties from being tied up indefinitely by inactive players, allowing others to utilize them. If a player logs in sporadically, approximately once a week, with the intention of bypassing the inactivity period, it will not be considered as fulfilling the requirement, and the removal process will proceed as planned.</p>
                                    <p>Indicating that you have no pulse three or more times will result in the permanent death of your character.</p>

                                    <div class="date">Last Updated: April 14, 2025</div>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Game Modifications, Cheating & Macros</strong></p>
                                    <p>Cheating ain't cool, folks. Using mods that give you unfair advantages like speed hacks, night vision, health regen, or teleporting is 100% banned. We're all about fair play here. Get caught cheating and you're gone - no warnings, just a permanent ban. Let's keep the game fun and fair for everyone.</p>
                                    <p>You're good to use visual mods that don't give you an edge - stuff that just makes the game look better without making you OP. Binding keys to common commands is totally fine too, as long as it doesn't give you superpowers other players don't have.</p>
                                    <p>Macros are a big no-no. No auto-clickers, no botting, no AFK farming scripts. If you're caught using macros to make money or bypass AFK systems, we'll wipe all your ill-gotten gains and show you the door. Play fair or don't play at all.</p>
                                    <p>Oh, and turn your shadows on! Playing without shadows gives you an unfair advantage, so keep 'em enabled.</p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Exploiting Bugs</strong></p>
                                    <p>No bug exploits allowed - period. If we catch you cheating with game glitches, you're banned. Anything you gained from exploits will be wiped clean.</p>
                                    <p>Stop camping spawns! Sitting in one spot farming animals or vehicles ruins the game for everyone. Play naturally - don't be that guy who breaks the immersion just to game the system.</p>
                                    <p>Don't try to cheat emote cooldowns either. Using F8 menu tricks or other workarounds isn't cool.</p>
                                    <p>Found a bug? Report it immediately on our Discord or any Provided recommend channel. Keeping quiet about exploits is just as bad as using them.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="content-inner">

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Communication Procedures</strong></p>
                                    
                                    <p>Speak English or risk a ban. While we allow other languages if everyone's cool with it, English is our common ground for fair play and moderation.</p>
                                    <p>No advertising other GTA communities or making cyber threats - instant permanent ban if you try. We take our community's safety seriously.</p>
                                    <p>Stop the spam! Whether it's text, commands, or annoying voice sounds, keep it reasonable or face consequences.</p>
                                    <p>RP trash talk is fine, but remember - anything you say in-character can lead to in-character consequences. Keep OOC (out-of-character) hate speech, racism, or real-life threats out of our community - zero tolerance for that garbage.</p>
                                    <p>Mic check! If your audio quality is terrible (whether from bad gear or voice changers), we'll help you fix it through tickets. But if you're just being obnoxious, that's a different story.</p>
                                    <p>Don't beef with staff. We're here to keep the game fun for everyone. If you're constantly causing drama or being difficult on purpose, you might get shown the door.</p>
                                
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">OOC Terminology</strong></p>
                                    <p>Keep OOC chat in Discord - no out-of-character talk in-game. We're all about that immersive RP life here.</p>
                                    <p>Don't break immersion with modern slang or meta terms. Stay in character and keep the fantasy alive for everyone.</p>
                                    <p>This city stands alone - no talking about other "counties" or "cities" that don't exist in our world.</p>
                                    <p>Your characters aren't related - no calling them "cousins" or "alt versions" of each other. Each character exists separately.</p>
                                    <p>Staff aren't "the government" - no meta references to admins or using phrases like "look to the skies."</p>
                                    <p>Keep spiritual/psychological RP to yourself - we're here for street-level stories, not mind games.</p>
                                    <p>Bugs happen - work around them in RP and report them later. Don't let glitches ruin good storylines.</p>
                                    <p>Don't call other players' RP "weird" or "strange" - everyone's here to have fun their own way.</p>
                                    <p>No telling cops they must be bored - that's straight OOC talk and breaks character.</p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Report</strong></p>
                                    <p>Got a player issue to report? Use our Discord ticketing system - it's the best way to document past or present incidents. This organized approach helps our staff handle your concerns properly and keeps our community safe. Remember, the in-game /report command is handy for immediate issues, but serious reports need proper tickets.</p>
                                    <p>When submitting a ticket, give us everything we need to investigate: timestamps, who was involved, screenshots, videos, or chat logs. The more details you provide, the faster and more accurately we can resolve your issue.</p>
                                    <p>We aim to resolve most reports within 48 hours, but complex cases might take up to a week. Your patience helps us ensure thorough investigations.</p>
                                    <p>Concerned about staff conduct? You can and should report potential power abuse through the same ticket system. We investigate all reports equally - no exceptions.</p>
                                    <p>Please don't DM staff about community issues - we'll just redirect you to the ticket system. This ensures proper documentation and fair treatment for everyone.</p>
                                    <p>Staff may pause your RP if rules are being broken. If this happens, they'll explain why through a Discord ticket so we keep everything transparent and above-board.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <p>Gang life isn't just about shooting - get creative with your crew! While conflicts are part of the game, we encourage unique gang concepts with different goals and stories. Think outside the box - your gang could specialize in business, have unique traditions, or focus on specific criminal ventures. The most memorable gangs bring something fresh to the streets.</p>
                                    <p>Talk before you shoot! Even if drama starts online, in-game conflicts need proper face-to-face RP. No drive-by roleplay - actually interact with people before pulling triggers. This makes for better stories and more satisfying conflicts for everyone involved.</p>
                                    <p>All gang rules and application info are in our Gang Handbook: <a href="/gangbook">Gangs Book</a></p>
                                    <p>No camping at job spots when taxing! You can't just sit idle waiting for deliveries - that's lazy RP. Put in the work to find and intercept targets properly.</p>
                                    <p>Taxing requires actual effort. Rolling up, pointing guns, and yelling "pay up" isn't enough. Create real interactions - investigate, set up proper ambushes, make it feel authentic. If your taxing RP is low effort, staff can shut it down.</p>
                                    <p>Staff can remove taxing rights for any job if payments get ridiculous. Keep it realistic - this isn't a money farm.</p>
                                    <p>No free gang gear! You can't use custom clothing, flags, or car liveries unless your character actually obtained them through proper RP. Earn your colors in-game.</p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Crime and it's activities</strong></p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Crew Limits:</strong> Most crimes are capped at 5 participants max (6 for Oil Rig). This includes everyone involved - no extra lookouts or radio help. Gangs can't move crimes to their turf just to bypass this rule.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Job Restrictions:</strong> Mechanics can't use their F1 menu during crimes. Separate groups can't team up on different jobs - work your own timers independently.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Prison Breaks:</strong> Transport attacks count as a new scenario - you can bring up to 5 fresh people for these.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Hostage Rules:</strong> Fake hostages are banned. If you take a hostage, make it real RP with proper commands and consequences.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Planning Matters:</strong> Major heists need actual plans - just running from cops isn't enough. Think through your approach for better RP.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Cooldown Times:</strong> <br>
                                    - Stores/Car Boosts: 45 mins <br>
                                    - Vangelico: 90 mins  <br>
                                    - Fleeca/Drug Runs: 120 mins <br>
                                    - Paleto/Pacific: 180 mins <br>
                                    These timers are shared - doing one locks you out of others.</p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Player Robberies:</strong> Allowed with good RP reason. Use proper commands and focus on the story, not just the cash grab.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Scamming Rules:</strong> Must have real RP behind it - no menu exploits or teleport tricks. Can't use broken game mechanics to scam.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">No-Rob Zones:</strong> Anywhere with a teleport function is off-limits for player robberies.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Interference Rules:</strong> Don't crash others' heists unless it's your gang's turf store being hit. No "revenge" interruptions allowed.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Government Protection:</strong> Can't rob PD/DOJ/EMS just to steal their gear - they're off limits for petty theft.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Restart Rules:</strong> No crimes 60 mins before or 30 mins after restart. For crashes, wait 15 mins before any illegal activity.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Area Camping:</strong> Can't stake out crime spots - if you check an area, leave for 5+ mins before returning.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Shooting Cooldown:</strong> 90-minute wait between any shootouts, regardless of scenario.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Traphouse Limits:</strong> Max 2 per group. Defense squads capped at 5 members. No killing NPCs to block codes - that's powergaming.</p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Shootout Rules:</strong> Always start with roleplay! Before any violence, you must verbally establish the conflict through proper RP interactions. This builds better stories and keeps the game immersive for everyone involved.</p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Self-Defense:</strong> You can defend yourself (or attack) if another player: <br>

                                    - No using cars as weapons without valid RP reasons (VDM) <br>
                                    - Even with RP reasons, running people over is considered low-quality roleplay <br>
                                    - Vehicle attacks must make sense in the story context</p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">COP BAITING:</strong> Don't just provoke cops for fights - there needs to be proper RP behind police interactions. Intentionally hitting cop cars just to start chases/shootouts is considered low-quality RP.</p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">SCENE USAGE:</strong> Use /scene to enhance RP atmosphere, not to disrupt or troll.</p>

                                    <p>*Remember: Good RP makes the experience better for everyone. Think realistically about your character's actions and reactions.</p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Value of Life</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Value of Life Rule:</strong> Treat your character's life as precious - avoid unnecessary risks and make realistic survival choices. You only get one life in our RP world.</p>

                                    - At clear disadvantage (e.g., gun to head)? Comply with demands <br>
                                    - Heavily outnumbered (3+ vs 1)? Generally should comply <br> 
                                    - Escape attempts must be realistic and situation-appropriate</p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Bad Escape Example:</strong> Trying to run from an armed bank hostage-taker who has you at gunpoint with no realistic chance of success.</p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Economy Rules</strong></p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Character & Asset Transfer Rules:</strong></p>

                                    <p>Creating "multiple" characters to transfer starter money or assets between your characters is strictly banned. This includes: <br>
                                    - Using new characters to funnel starter cash <br>
                                    - Transferring accumulated assets between characters <br>
                                    - Any form of wealth redistribution between your characters</p> <br>

                                    <p>Violations will result in: <br>
                                    - Complete revocation of all involved funds <br>
                                    - Potential bans for all related characters <br>
                                    - Removal of improperly transferred assets</p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Asset Sale Restrictions:</strong></p>

                                    <p>All vehicle/asset sales must follow script limitations: <br>
                                    - Never bypass LSRS app restrictions <br>
                                    - No under-the-table payments to circumvent fees <br>
                                    - Total sale price must match the script transaction</p> <br>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Prohibited Example:</strong> <br>
                                    Travis sells import ($360k value) to Taylor: <br>
                                    - Taylor sends $640k direct transfer <br>
                                    - Then pays $360k through LSRS app <br>
                                    - This illegally avoids proper asset fees on the full $1M value</p>

                                    <p><strong style="color: #fff;">New Role Implementation:</strong> <br>
                                    The Economic Oversight role will: <br>
                                    - Monitor all high-value transactions <br> 
                                    - Audit suspicious asset transfers <br>
                                    - Enforce fair market practices <br>
                                    - Investigate potential exploitation</p>

                                    <p><strong style="font-style: italic;">*If you have an issue, open a ticket to discuss it with server staff rather than impacting morale negatively.</strong></p>
